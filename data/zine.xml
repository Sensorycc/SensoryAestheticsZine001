	   <body>Hello fellow foocamper! Welcome to the first issue of the Sensory Aesthetics zine. This zine is about creating dialogue around the future of computing and humanity and we made it especially for you at Foocamp 2015. It is printed in small run additions but the source code is readily available at http://www.github.com/sensoryaesthetics. Sensory Aesthetics was conceived of by James Tichenor (@jamestichenor) and Joshua Walton (@brunchstorm), two interaction designers with a love for how computing can extend and augment human understanding and capability. We hope you enjoy the zine and please come find us or contact us @sensoryixd with questions or comments.

Talk soon,
Joshua and James

	   	* 1. Write some code that will fill an xml template with content using various 
	   	* content types popularized by Robert Horn in Mapping Hypertext. You can also 
	   	* just replace the contents in zine.xml by hand.
	   	* 2. Pick the parameters of your zine.
	   	* 3. Hit Run, Wait, Open the generated zine pdf, print, and assemble.

	   <heading>Human Attention</heading>
	   <subheading></subheading>
	   <body>As humans we often move our input senses to the background of our brain to focus more on our thoughts. This activity ranges from staring into space when lost in thought or sticking your tounge out of your mouth when you are trying to concentrate, or turning down the radio when you need to focus on driving. How often do we use this technique with machines. How often do we need to turn off one mode of input to put more energy towards calculations. As we do this more will this lead to machines ignoring us more when they are tired. Will machines begin to develop attention spans. As much as we try and create this illusion with our digital assistants can a machine truly have any attention to give?</body>

	   <body>On November 28th 2014 rapper Lil B crossed the threshold of following a million people. Inverting the usual paradigm of how celebrities use social media, Lil B celebrates not how many people follow him but rather how many people he follows.  In his own words: “HEY TWITTER I FOLLOWED 1 MILLION + PEOPLE WITH MY BARE HANDS !!! ALL MYSELF !!!! HISTORY! WOW – Lil B”
Personally i find it mind boggling to even understand what that might mean. Imagine we suspend disbelief for a few minutes and really imagine that he actually reads for one day all the tweets of all the people he follows. The proposition here is that his fame (on twitter) is not for what he says but rather how he listens. His genuine interest in hearing from his fans transforms his celebrity from one of output to one of input.
To me this makes him a hero of sensing, someone who is pushing the envelope on input,

“When Bob and I did this design, we thought we were building a system to connect computers together. What we very quickly discovered is that this was a system for connecting people together. And what you’ve seen tonight tells you that we should not restrict this network to one species, that these other intelligent, sentient species should be part of the system too. “
Biomass is biological material derived from living, or recently living organisms.

	   <body>Communal Computing: The room, the house, the city, the nation. The table, couch, piazza, court square, bus stop, fountain, spectacle, party. If the 1968 goal was… “Extending and Augmenting human capability” then we need to augment with object and environments to achieve the next stage. We just scratched the surface with computing so far.

	   <heading>Reality TV as Computing Simulation</heading>
	   <subheading></subheading>
	   <body>A computer simulation is a simulation, run on a single computer, or a network of computers, to reproduce behavior of a system. The simulation uses an abstract model (a computer model, or a computational model) to simulate the system. Reality TV is a simulation run on a group of participants and observers to model and reproduce behavior of a system. The Reality show uses an abstract model of reality to simulate reality.</body>

	   <body>So many of the “tools to think with” that we create are so blunt and straightforward. I am interested in better understanding how environments are tools to think with. Why do we change the way we think when we change where we go, we know this intuitively but not so clearly with rigor. </body>

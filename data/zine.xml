	   <heading>Thank you for taking the time to read this zine. We had a few goals when we set out to write it and would love feedback.  Our goal were to discuss:
Why should we invent computing to extend and augment humans? How will it teach us more deeply about ourselves?
How can we extend our technologies to the objects and environments which help define who we are and how we live? What new sensing will need to be created?
What if we understood an acre of land? What if the biomass of the earth were networked?

		Hello fellow foocamper! Welcome to the first issue of the Sensory Aesthetics fanzine. This zine is about creating dialogue around the future of computing and humanity and we made it especially for you at Foocamp 02015. It is printed in small run editions (you are holding <var key="num"></var>/200) but the source code is readily available at http://www.github.com/sensoryaesthetics. Sensory Aesthetics was conceived of as a generative fanzine by James Tichenor (@jamestichenor) and Joshua Walton (@brunchstorm), two interaction designers with a love for how computing can extend and augment human understanding and capability. We hope you enjoy the zine and please come find us or contact us @sensoryixd with questions or comments. We look forward to meeting you.

Warm Regards, 
James and Joshua

	   <heading>Compute Thyself</heading>
	   <subheading></subheading>
	   <body>The history of computing can follow a line of augmenting and extending human capability. Through this pursuit we have learned a great deal about what it means to be human. For instance in the pursuit of language translation we have come to deeper understanding of the complexity and dynamism of human language. As humans we often move the conscious interpretation of our senses to the ‘background’ of our brain to focus more on our thoughts. From staring into space when lost in thought, sticking your tongue out of your mouth when you are trying to concentrate, or to turning down the radio when you need to focus on driving we intuitively arrange our sense ratios. We see complex cloud configurations beginning to work this way, but how often do we use this technique with machines? How often do we need to turn off one mode of input to put more energy towards calculations? How can we create interactions in the periphery? Which technologies support the subconscious computation, the nuanced reaction, the laissez faire commitment? Do our machines choose to ignore us when they are tired? What is the attention span of the machine? Do they ever really give us their attention?

	   <subheading>Unlikely Hero of Sensing: Lil B</subheading>
	   <body>On November 28th, 2014 rapper Lil B crossed the threshold of following a million people on twitter. Inverting the usual paradigm of how celebrities use social media, Lil B celebrates not how many people follow him but rather how many people he follows.  In his own words: 

“HEY TWITTER I FOLLOWED 1 MILLION + PEOPLE WITH MY BARE HANDS !!! ALL MYSELF !!!! HISTORY! WOW – Lil B”

Imagine we suspend our disbelief and that he reads for one day all of the tweets of all the people he follows. The mind boggles. The proposition here is that his fame (on twitter) is not for what he says but rather how he listens. His genuine interest in hearing from his fans transforms his celebrity from one of output to one of input. That is why Lil B is today’s hero of sensing.

Who are your heroes of sensing?

	   <subheading>2015 The Pace of Social Change</subheading>
	   <!-- http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-pace-of-social-change/ -->
	   <body>
We believe the rising pace of social change is related to an increasing trend towards empathy. Empathy and sensing share a close relationship. When we hear, see, and otherwise sense the people around us we can practice empathy. 

Recently a study with suprising results: almost 75 percent of students today rate themselves as less empathic than the average student 30 years ago (Sara H. Konrath of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor led the study and published it in Personality and Social Psychology Review).

So what is the future of empathy? If we can teach each other empathy can we begin to encapsulate that behavior into our computation? Is technology to blame for this recent decline? Are we moving beyond the need for empathy? 

Some ways to practice empathy:
1. Listen boldly.
2. Be curious about others and the world.
3. When you see two ways, look for a third. 
4. Wonder like a child.
5. Take the other side.

		"In Ridley Scott’s film Blade Runner, empathy-detection devices are employed to measure affiliative emotions. Despite recent neurocomputational advances, it is unknown whether brain signatures of affiliative emotions, such as tenderness/affection, can be decoded and voluntarily modulated. Here, we employed multivariate voxel pattern analysis and real-time fMRI to address this question. We found that participants were able to use visual feedback based on decoded fMRI patterns as a neurofeedback signal to increase brain activation characteristic of tenderness/affection relative to pride, an equally complex control emotion. Such improvement was not observed in a control group performing the same fMRI task without neurofeedback. Furthermore, the neurofeedback-driven enhancement of tenderness/affection-related distributed patterns was associated with local fMRI responses in the septohypothalamic area and frontopolar cortex, regions previously implicated in affiliative emotion. This demonstrates that humans can voluntarily enhance brain signatures of tenderness/affection, unlocking new possibilities for promoting prosocial emotions and countering antisocial behavior.""

We can all relate to the need to alter our environment to inhabit changes to our thinking. But how much do we really understand this phenomenon? Current computers act as tools to extend the powers of humans minds, using primarily text and two dimensional media. Spacemind proposes that the true value of the internet of things is that the things are already part of our mind. The objects in our environment and the environment itself are going through a bits to atoms and atoms to bits transformation. We need to understand what differences make a difference in our environments and how that augments our thoughts. As object and environments become digital how will they transform?

		<heading>Nothing is Static</heading>
		<subheading>  </subheading>
		<body>


In the Felix Hess piece ‘It’s in the Air’ the artist has created three hundred small and lightweight flags which move to the fluctuations present in the environment. If the human remains ‘still’ the flags will move in accordance with the heat tunnel forming the air around the human.

“Human sense organs can receive only news of difference, and the differences must be coded into events in time (i.e., into changes) in order to be perceptible. Ordinary static differences that remain constant for more than a few seconds become perceptible, only by scanning. Similarly, very slow changes become perceptible only by a combination of scanning and bringing together observations from separated moments in the continuum of time.”  -Gregory Bateson

Where we see the static phenomenon we need to only look closer or further to understand that it is not static at all. How can we develop new types of sensing to look not at the state, but at the transition? When should state and when should you look for transition? When we examine the phenomenon of the universe how do we find the difference that makes a difference?

	   <body>Many of the types of personal computing devices we have can be linked to one of the descriptions used by Mark Weiser when he said “My colleagues and I have built what we call tabs, pads and boards: inch-scale machines that approximate active Post-It notes, foot-scale ones that behave something like a sheet of paper (or a book or a magazine), and yard-scale displays that are the equivalent of a blackboard or bulletin board.”

As Mark Weiser said, "we are trying to conceive a new way of thinking about computers in the world, one that takes into account the natural human environment and allows the computers themselves to vanish into the background."

 	<heading>Information Acre</heading>
	   <subheading>   </subheading>
	   <body>

	   	Imagine the bit as the toss of a fair coin. The result is either heads or tails. The "holographic principle" would suggest that there is a limit to the number of bits which physics can support. This amount is placed at 10^69 bits per square meter before the point in which adding more information would collapse into a black hole. This is approximately 1, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000 bits per square meter of two dimensional space.

Our proposal: Dedicate 1 square acre of land to the deep pursuit of sensing. Bring scientists, artists, hardware and software designers together to try to make a dent in that information space. Sense the biology, the chemistry, the conditions, and the human reaction to that one acre. Publish this material for the world. 

We have tentatively named this project Information Acre and are currently looking for a suitable area in the Pacific Northwest for this to occur.

	   	The Information Acre project is a small step inspired by the audacious goal set forth by the the founders of the interspecies internet project. Neil Gershenfeld, one of the founding members, describes that part of the goal is "starting to think about how you integrate the rest of the biomass of the planet into the internet".
